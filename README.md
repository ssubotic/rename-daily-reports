A utility for more easily updating nightly hotel reports by searching for key words in the file names and renaming accordingly.

The GUI requires the housing directory's complete path, and the files will be renamed to: "{report type} {directory name}" 

The housing directory's name is intended to be the relevant date for the reports (mm-dd-yyyy, "August 8th, 2017", etc).
